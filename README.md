# SheepBoy: A Wiki-Based Indie Game Information Archive

#### This repository contains code for an interactive web application created by Nikolai Nilsen and Hojun Kim.

**_Sheepboy_** is an interactive web application that contains a growing library of indie games. 

The application's initial layout provides all available games in a designated section of the page, and if a user would like to search for a specific game, he/she can utilize our dropdowns to add filters and tags to the results. We also provide a searchbox, so that the user has more freedom and options for filtering through the available games. All tags and applied filters are removable by click and are distinguished by a border. 

As of our initial launch, there are only 24 available games, but we hope the number increases as users add more games. 

In addition to viewing game information, users can also create an account or log in to create new pages or alter existing pages using our provided editing template, which simplifies the process of updating information for the users. To view a filled out version of this template, please visit the 'Gato Roboto' game page and click 'edit'. Click 'Create Page' to update the page information for the game.

The application is designed to be responsive, meaning it supports and looks good on multiple devices of varying screen resolutions, including smartphones. Our project was also bootstrapped with Create React App.

Our goal of this project is to provide a simple-enough-to-use application with smooth and frictionless functionality that will help improve the representation of indie games.
