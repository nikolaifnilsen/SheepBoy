		<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		<h3>What are Indie games?</h3>
			<p>
				Indie games refer to any video game, more often than not PC-based video games, developed by a small group, or even a single person. This is meant to differentiate games between those developed by well-known video game developers and studios, such as Nintendo, EA, Ubisoft, or Blizzard. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Indie games became a more main-stream term with the rise of PCs in the household, the creation of commercialized video game developing software such as RPG Maker, Unity, and GameMaker Studio, and platforms to play and sell Indie games on such as Steam. These components shifted the dynamic of video games away from console-based gaming, such as the Playstation and Xbox, which were much less accessible for smaller groups to develop games on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, there exists a flood of new and emerging Indie games in the online marketplace. This, however leads to some problems for those gaming enthusiasts interested in finding a game to play.
			</p>

		<h3>Problem - Discovery and Archiving</h3>
			<p>
				With so many games being developed and published, how can the customer find the game that they want? This "Discovery" problem is present in many types of entertainment media, such as music, movies, and TV, and video games suffer from it as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				Additionally, while some exceptional Indie games rise above the rest and last beyond a couple days after their release, the majority do not, and are quickly forgotton and lost. Again, this "Archiving" problem is also present in other forms of entertainment media.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Both of these issues are primarily an information problem, and as such can be appropriately solved, or at least alleviated, through information-based solutions.
			</p>

			<p>
				So why focus on Indie games specifically, rather than on video games in general? To put simply, the lack of maturity of the scene, as well as the explosive potential for it to proliferate after moving from console-based platforms to PC-based platforms, exaserbates the issues mentioned previously. More and more games will be published, and the infrastructure by which these games will be discovered, digested, and stored has had less time to develop compared to previous generations.
			</p>

			<p>
				While the solutions in the present day are working to alleviate the issues with discovery, very little is done to solve archiving these games, nor does there exist a platform which aims to do both. Discovery-based solutions often focus on profits or the marketplace. This means that these platforms focus on selling what is new and hot, rather than making an effort to sell last year's products save for a few exceptional ones.
			</p>

			<p>
				Archival solutions are sparce, and consist of wiki-based approaches. This leaves very little in the way of discovery as you almost always need to know what to look for in the first place in order to look up more information on these platforms.
			</p>

		<h3>Examples of Current Solutions</h3>
			
			<h4>Discovery-Based Solutions:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li> 
					<a href="https://itch.io/"><strong>Itch</strong></a> - A web-based marketplace for Indie games. Includes features for discovering, rating, and following the development of Indie games. 
				</li>

				<li>
					<a href="https://gamejolt.com/"><strong>Gamejolt</strong></a> - Another web-based marketplace for Indie games. Very similar to Itch in functionality.
				</li>

				<li>
					<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/"><strong>Steam</strong></a> - The "gold standard" of online gaming marketplaces/platforms. It offers more than just Indie Games on sale, but many find themselves sold by the service.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<strong>Gaming media outlets</strong> - Some Indie games end up being featured on gaming media websites such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">Rock-Paper-Shotgun</a>. Though, the majority of the gaming media's attention is not on Indie games, typically featuing only very popular Indie games.
				</li>

			</ul>

			<h4>Archival-Based Solutions:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.fandom.com/"> <strong>Fandom</strong> </a> - A wiki website which utilizes "sub-wikis" to
					divide information between specific topics. Includes sections for many Indie games as well.
				</li>

				<li>
					<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"> <strong>Wikipedia</strong> </a> - The wiki which started them all. Contains articles on some more well-known Indie games. 
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Emulator &amp; ROM Sites</strong> - To sum up very quickly, Emulators and ROMs allow users to play older console games on PCs and mobile devices. These websites archive these games and allow for the discovery of them through filters, reviews, and descriptions. This isn't a direct solution to the issues stated above, but they prove that these issues have been dealt with before the Indie game boom. <strong>BROWSE AT YOUR OWN RISK!</strong> Many of these sites are shady, and the use and sharing of ROMs is illegal
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>App Descrption/Functionality</h2>
		<h3>What is the app?</h3>
		<p>
			My proposed app will be a web service that uses the discovery-aspects of Indie game marketplace platforms (such as the use of tags and filtering) on a community-driven archival platform (like wikipedia) for Indie games. Users will be able to search, filter, and bookmark entries for Indie games that contain relevant links and information on it. Users will be able to add and edit these entries as games are added or are changed. THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE AN APP FOR SELLING OR MARKETING GAMES!
		</p>

		<h3>Who are the users?</h3>
		<p>
			The intended userbase are gaming enthusiasts with an interest in discovering older, more aged Indie games that have fallen off the wayside. While currently the target audience will be in their late teens/early adulthood, as the Indie game scene ages and matures the audience base will in turn begin to age as well. You could say that my intended audience is similar to music/movie enthusiasts and historians, who are looking for older media to digest.
		</p>

		<h3>How will this app help?</h3>
		<p>
			This app aims to give a more discovery-based approach to the traditional wikipedia model of archiving information, but with Indie games. Users will hopefully be able to find Indie games that appeal to them regardless of whether they are "current" or "popular". Thus, the app will solve both "discovery" and "archival" issues that plague entertainment-based media in the context of Indie games.
		</p>

		<h3>App Flow</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>From the home page, user clicks on a tab on the left of the screen to open the left panel, containing filtering options.</li>
				<li>User clicks on the "Filter by title" search bar, types in keywords contained in the title of the Indie game to be searched for, and clicks the "add" button to add them to the search query.</li>
				<li>The above process can be applied with separate search bars labelled "Filter by Developer", "Filter by Platform", and "Filter by Release Year" located in the left panel.</li>
				<li>User clicks on popular pre-set tags in the left panel to add them to the search query. Alternatively, they can add tags to the search query using the "Filter by tags" search bar located above the pre-set tags by typing in tags and the clicking "add" button next to it.</li>
				<li>User clicks on the "search" button at the top of the left panel, and the user is brought to a search results page.</li>
				<li>User can click two different tabs at the top of the search results to view results as either "text view", containing only the title of each entry, or in "picture view", which includes both the title and the main picture of the entry.</li>
				<li>Afterwards, the user clicks on the desired search result, and are brought to the entry page, where the user can view information about the game, or edit the page.</li>
				<li>If the user wants to, they may click on the "edit" button located at the top right of the page while viewing an entry, just above the title and main picture. This brings them to an alternate view of the page, where information may be edited, and the edit history may be accessed.</li>
				<li>At any point during this process, users may instead click on the "add entry" button located at the top right of the page. This brings them to a blank entry page, where users may fill in information about an Indie game, including title, main picture, tags, developer, release date, platform, screenshots, and any text describing the game.</li>
